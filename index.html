	<h1>Hi there, I'm Aashaka!</h1>
	<p><img src="headshot.JPG" alt="Aashaka, an Indian woman with short curly black hair, smiling with bluegreen water in the background." style="float:left;height:350px;padding-right:50px;"> I'm a PhD candidate at Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, co-advised by Dr. Jennifer Mankoff and Dr. Richard Ladner. Broadly, my research is in the area of accessibility and human-computer interaction. I like to explore ways in which technology and people can mediate access, particularly in communication contexts. </p> 
	
	<p> My dissertation work explores how we might better reflect multilingual and multimodal realities of d/DHH communication — signing, speaking, speechreading, writing, gesturing — in the study and design of communication accessibility technology. I'm increasingly curious about what it means to center the concept of <i>languaging</i> in this work, and how we might support minoritized access practices and fluidity of language use. </p> 

	<p>In 2020, I graduated from University of Delaware with Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Cognitive Science, where I was advised by Dr. Debra Yarrington and Dr. Giovanna Morini. I'm also a UD Women's Golf Alumna!</p>
