  <h3 style="font-size:1.2em;">Understanding Speechreading</h3>
	<p style="font-size:1.0em;"><img src="/representations.png" alt="shapes and colors and positions mapped to phonemes" style="float:left;height:100px;height:150px;width:150px;padding-right:30px;"> Speechreading is the art of using visual and contextual cues in the environment to support listening. Often used by d/Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (d/DHH) individuals, it highlights nuances of rich communication. However, lived experiences of speechreaders are underdocumented in the literature, and the impact of online environment and interaction of captioning with speechreading has not been explored. To bridge these gaps, we conducted a three-part study consisting of formative interviews, design probes and design sessions with 12 d/DHH individuals who speechread.</p> 

  <h3 style="font-size:1.2em;">Innovators</h3>
	<p style="font-size:1.0em;"><img src="/tty.jpeg" alt="image of an old TTY, tall grey machine with keyboard on front side, and several buttons on top" style="float:left;height:100px;height:150px;width:150px;padding-right:30px;">Qualitative study of the design activities of persons with disabilities who have innovated accessibility technology. Conducted semi-structured interviews with innovators to explore how their life and learning experiences have influenced their design choices, along with review of historical record using thematic analysis.</p>
    
  <h3 style="font-size:1.2em;">Exploring Embroidered Tactile Graphics</h3>
  <p style="font-size:1.0em;"><img src="/textures.JPG" alt="12 embroidered circles in a grid with different patterns " style="float:left;height:100px;height:150px;width:150px;padding-right:30px;">Tactile graphics convey rich visual information through a sense of touch, and are of accessible to blind or low vision (BLV) individuals. However, traditional techniques are expensive and require specialized knowledge. Here we explore the use of machine embroidery, which is affordable and readily available, to create tactile graphics. We have evaluated different embroidery stitches, patterns and techniques for tactile contrast. Based on our results, we are designing a tool to support creation interactive embroidered tactile graphics.</p>
